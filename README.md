Find areas with highest cash flow investment properties

This project is to identify areas where purchasing an investment property will result in a positive/net-zero cash flow. I have used rental data from Redfin as a basis to determine cities with the best cash flow on investment properties. This data is for June 2022. All the assumptions made are listed below.
